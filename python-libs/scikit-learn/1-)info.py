    - Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning.
    - It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, 
    - gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.


    imports:
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


    All Codes Which I Learn:

    - train_X, test_X, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0) --> u can use also validation data, train, validation and test data
